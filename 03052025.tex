\section{Relative clauses: subject, object (Wesley)}

\wml{
\begin{itemize}
    \item With RCs, there does not seem to be `true embedding' where the RC sticks with the modified NP in its argument position. Instead, I hypothesise that Anthony was using these strategies:
    %
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Topicalise the RC-modified NP, e.g. \ref{man_broke_bondu_bought_topicalised}, \ref{bondu_see_man_break_topicalised}
        \item Extrapose the RC to the right, e.g. \ref{bondu_see_man_break_extraposed}, \ref{bondu_bought_man_break_extraposed}
        \item Topicalise and cleft, e.g. \ref{bondu_buy_kai_cook_cleft}
    \end{itemize}
    %
    \item The only example without any of these strategies is with an AdjP predicate \ref{bondu_buy_meat_delicious}
    %

    \item Relative clauses are marked with \textsc{mi} in the position relativised upon, e.g.  \ref{bondu_bought_man_break_extraposed}. This seems to be related to `which' in `which student' from Giang's data, so perhaps these are relative pronoun.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item In \ref{bondu_see_man_break_extraposed}, however, we see the Series 2 marking \textit{n\'{a}} alongside \textsc{mi}. Unless \textit{n\'{a}} is resumptive here, this data could support the idea that the `pronominal forms' have some auxiliary status.
        \end{itemize}
    %
    \item With relativisation on the object position, it seems as though RCs are internally-headed, e.g. \ref{kai_cook_bondu_buy_cleft}. That is, while we might expect \textit{?swee [\mss{RC} Kai a mi-tawa]}, with the head noun \textit{swee} outside of the RC and hence above the agent \textit{Kai}, we see it below the agent Kai, presumably within the RC.
\end{itemize}

\section{Embedded questions (Joey)}

\jf{Follow-up on last week:}

\exg. te\\
    `Say' \jf{(This appears to take ɔ-series as subject - need more variety re: subjects with this to see whether it is actually an ɔ-series subject)}\\

\exg. N-do te\\
1SG-OBJ say\\
    `I say' \\


\jf{ask:} 

\exg. tisa\\
    `ask"\\ 

\exg. tisa-t͡ʃe\\
ask-v\\
    `ask"\\ 

\jf{In the example above, the context that Tony provided suggested that the t͡ʃe suffix was used for imperatives; however, this analysis will be complicated by the use of t͡ʃe in the embedded question below that takes "who" as its subject. (64)}


\exg. n-a bondu ɔ tisa ne a swee dao faŋ kunu\\
1SG.PST Bondu 3SG.ɔSer ask whether 3SG.PST meat eat ? yesterday \\
    `I asked Bondu whether she ate meat yesterday"\\

\jf{Tony said that nea means "whether;" however, in other examples using "whether," he simply said ne. An alternative analysis of the above sentence keeping "whether" as ne can be seen below:}

\exg. n-a bondu ɔ tisa ne a swee dao faŋ kunu\\
1SG.PST  Bondu 3SG.ɔSer ask whether 3SG.PST .Ser2 meat eat ? yesterday \\
    `I asked Bondu whether she ate meat yesterday"\\


\exg. n-ɔ tisa ne bondu a swee dao faŋ kunu\\
1SG.PST -3SG.ɔSer ask whether Bondu AUX.PST. meat eat ? yesterday \\
    `I asked him/her whether Bondu ate meat yesterday" \jf{(the "a" in "na" (1SG.Ser2) seems to be elided and replaced by "ɔ" 3SG.ɔSer)}\\

\exg. na jɔ tisa ne bondu a swee dao faŋ kunu\\
1SG.PST 2SG.ɔSer ask whether Bondu AUX.PST meat eat ? yesterday \\
    `I asked you (sg.) whether Bondu ate meat yesterday"\\

\jf{It appears to be impossible to say "I asked" without an indirect object. "tisa" necessarily appears to be ditransitive.}

\jf{It is unclear to me what purpose faŋ serves. It doesn't seem to be necessary in non-question embedded CPs, per the example below from the previous week:}

\exg. kai à na-fɔ́ bondu à swee dao kunu\\
Kai 3SG ?-say Bondu 3SG.PST meat eat yesterday\\
    `He says that Bandu ate meat yesterday'\\

\jf{It is possible that faŋ may be some sort of question-marker?}

\exg. n-ɔ tisa bondu a feŋ dao kunu\\
1SG.Ser2-3SG.ɔSer ask Bondu 3SG.Ser2 what eat yesterday\\
    `I asked what Bondu ate yesterday"\\

\jf{The wh-word in embedded questions appears to remain in-situ in Kono, per the above.}

\exg. n-a tisa-t͡ʃe ɲon-á swee dao kunu\\
1SG.PST ask-v who-AUX.PST meat eat yesterday\\
    `I asked who (pl.) ate meat yesterday" \jf{(Like, if some people meat and others vegetables)}\\ 

\exg. n-ɔ tisa ɲon-á swee dao kunu\\
1SG.Ser2-3SG.ɔSer ask who-3SG.PST meet eat yesterday\\
    `I asked who (pl.) ate meat yesterday" \jf{(Like, if some people meat and others vegetables)}\\ 

\jf{There seems to be some difference between tisa and tisa-t͡ʃe that is not the same as an indicative vs. imperative distinction. Interestingly, when the -t͡ʃe is present, there is no ɔ-series indirect object present. Perhaps the -t͡ʃe suffix indicates that the verb is not ditransitive and that is why it works in the imperative context (ie: "ask it" not "ask me it.")}

\exg. ɲon-à\\
who-sg\\
    `who (sg.)" \\

\exg. ɲon-à swee dao kunu\\
who-3SG.PST meat eat yesterday\\
    `Who (sg.) ate meat yesterday?"\\

\jf{I wonder if ɲon-à is just ɲon + à (3SG.Ser2), and if ɲon-á is a shortened version of ɲon + àná (3PL.Ser2)}
    

\exg. fenama bondu a swee dao kunu\\
why Bondu 3SG.PST meat eat yesterday\\
    `Why did Bondu eat meat yesterday?"\\

\exg. na tisa-t͡ʃe fenama bondu a swee dao kunu\\
1SG.PST ask-v why Bondu 3SG.PST meat eat yesterday\\
    `I asked why Bondu ate meat yesterday" \jf{(with -t͡ʃe)}\\

\exg. n-ɔ tisa fenama bondu a swee dao kunu\\
1SG.Ser2-3SG.ɔSer ask why Bondu 3SG.PST meat eat yesterday\\
    `I asked why Bondu ate meat yesterday" \jf{(without -t͡ʃe)}\\

\exg. tima\\
    `time"\\

\exg. bondu a swee dao kunu tima-minana\\
Bondu 3SG.PST meat eat yesterday time-which\\
    `When did Bondu eat meat?"\\

\exg. bondu a swee dao tima-minana kunu\\
Bondu 3SG.PST meat eat time-which yesterday\\
    `When did Bondu eat meat?"\\

\jf{Placement of "when" can apparently come before or after "yesterday"}

\exg. na tisa-t͡ʃe bondu a swee dao tima-minana kunu\\
1SG.PST ask-v Bondu 3SG.PST meat eat time-which yesterday\\
    `I asked when Bondu ate meat yesterday"\\
