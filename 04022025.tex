`I will close tomorrow.' \label{I will close tomorrow}

\alex{In fast speech, I hear the subject+aux form pronounced as \textit{nɛɛ}.}

\alex{The sentence in \ref{I will not close tomorrow} is the negative version of \ref{I will close tomorrow}. Note that you cannot simply use `tonal negation' in \ref{I will close tomorrow}. Thus, it seems there is something interesting happening in \ref{I will not close tomorrow}, namely in the ``loss'' of the object marker on the pronominal subject}

\exg.

\exg.
am    ma    te-ni    \\
3PL   NEG   break-NI \\%
`They did not break.' \label{They did not break2}

\alex{The difference between \ref{They did not break1} and \ref{They did not break2} seems to amount to the presence/absence of the `object marker', where in \ref{They did not break1}, the object marker is present and surfaces as \textit{dɔ} on the surface subject, where as in \ref{They did not break2}, the object marker is absent, in which case, the negation form cliticizes to the surface subject.}

\alex{Still not entirely sure that the \textit{-ni} particle is. Sometimes it looks like it is tracking negation in past/perfective forms. Other times it looks like it is tracking something like a past progressive?}

\exg.
a     ma    te-ni    \\
3SG   NEG   break-NI \\%
`It did not break.' \label{It did not break}

\alex{The difference between the 3PL subject in \ref{They did not break2} and the 3SG subject in \ref{It did not break} seems to surface as something like gemination of the nasal consonant + negation.}

\exg.

\exg.
ámbéé         te-a    \\
3PL.AUX.NEG   break-A \\%

\exg. Bondu túmú-á dè-á\\
{} love-\textsc{AUX.PST} mother-\textsc{a}\\
`Bondu loves his mother.’\\
\wml{At first I was confused about \textit{mother-\textsc{a}} being post-verbal, but then realised we've seen other examples of animate objects/internal arguments being post-verbal, e.g. the recipient of \textit{tell} in the 19 March elicitations. So perhaps this isn't so surprising, and the \textsc{-a} is the regular object marking we see generally.}

\exg. Bondu dè nàà Bajama sìná\\
{} mother come {} tomorrow\\
`Bondu’s mother is coming to Bajama tomorrow.’

\exg. Bondu túmú-á dè-á mím-bè nàà Bajama sìná \\

`Kai knows Bondu.’

\ex. wã̀\\`live, inhabit’

\exg. Bondu sìì-jɔ́ Bajama wã̀\\
{} sit-? {} live\\
`Bondu lives in Bajama.’\\
\wml{Tony said \textit{sìì} means sit---not sure then what \textit{-jɔ́} means.}

\exg. Bondu mín-sìì mú Bajama, Kai a sɔ́ɱfã̀\\

\exg. Kai a Bondu sɔ́ɱfã̀, mín-sìì mú Bajama\\

\exg. Bondu mín jã́sã̀, Kai à sɔ́ɱfã̀\\
{} \textsc{mi} tall \textsc{AUX.PST} {} know\\
`Kai knows Bondu, who is tall.’

\wml{Tony seems to produce mín with a nasal before jã́sã̀ in the topicalised version but mĩ́ (with no nasal stop) in the extraposed one, where he pauses. I guess this is likely due to the pause rather than anything else about the local structure of the sentences, which are the same, i.e. \textsc{mi}+jã́sã̀.}

\wml{For the following, with appositives modifying pronominal subjects, we see part of a paradigm with \textit{fɛ́nà} and \textit{wɛ́nà} forms similar to what Giang got for focus: \textit{fana, wana...}. Could these all be part of the same paradigm as \textit{ana} which we've been seeing here and there? I will follow up by testing these sentences with past tense.}

\exg. í-wɛ́nà Bondu sɔ̃̀, é nàà wã̀ sìná\\

\section{Predicative possessives - Chun-Hung}


\chs{\textbf{Plan of this week}: continue getting a descriptive sketch and try to get some comparisons between possessives and locatives}

\chs{inalienable relations (others: sister, son, daughter)}
\newline

\chs{
\textbf{Constructions}: \newline
series.I-brother + wan $\rightarrow$ temporary possession?
\newline
series.I-brother + wanu $\rightarrow$ temporary possession? 
\newline
brother + wa + series.I-hand
\newline \newline
*1SG.I-want.to [1SG money ma-wa-1SG.I-hand in the future]. $\rightarrow$ possessor in hand-construction cannot be controlled PRO, probably not a grammatical subject 
\newline \newline
1SG.I-want.to [1SG money get/receive in the future]. $\rightarrow$ possessor in transitive-like construction be controlled PRO
\newline \newline
C. (2025) points that the default pattern for predicative possessives is expressed by `hand' throughout out the Mande family; only few of them have typical transitive (bivalent) constructions, which may be due to the language contact with other language families.
