\subsection{Basic Questions:}

\exg. j-á fèɱ fɔ̀\\
2SG-PST what say\\
`what did you say?' \jf{(fo)}\\

\exg. j-ɔ́ fẽ̀ \\
2SG-3SG.ɔSER what \\
`what did you (say)?' \\

\jf{Perhaps the above is not just used for "say" but could be used for it in correct context. }

\exg. bòndú á fèɱ fɔ̀\\
Bondu AUX.PST what say\\
`what did Bondu say?' \jf{(fo)}\\

\exg. j-ɔ́ té kámà\\
2SG-3SG.ɔSER say regarding\\
`what did you say?' \\

\exg. bòndú ɔ́ té kámà\\
Bondu 3SG.ɔSER say regarding\\
`what did you say?' \\

\jf{NOTE: for the above with te, there is no actual wh-phrase. It appears to be more like, "you said...." which we have seen with other te phrases}

\exg. j-á ìnàt͡ʃìì kámà\\
2SG-PST think regarding\\
`what did you think?' \\

\exg. bòndú á ìnàt͡ʃìì kámà\\
Bondu AUX.PST think regarding\\
`what did Bondu think?' \\

\jf{NOTE: This is the same as te, in that it doesn't take wh-OBJ}

\exg. èj-á fèn àmì\\
2SG-PST what hear\\
`What did you hear?' \jf{(Elicited 4/23/25)}\\

\exg. bòndú á fèn àmí\\
Bondu AUX.PST what hear\\
`what did Bondu hear?' \\


\exg. bòndú á tìsá mìn-ànt͡ʃè\\
Bondu AUX.PST ask which-the.process.itself\\
`what did Bondu ask?' \\

\exg. j-á tìsá mìn-ànt͡ʃè\\
2SG-PST ask which-the.process.itself\\
`what did you ask?' \\

\jf{The above ask examples have glosses based on insights from Tony, but more analysis is needed. It should be NOTED that Tony translated "Tisa" here as "question" not "ask," so it seems more like "which question did you/Bondu (ask)?"}


\jf{NOTE: Above patterns like fo and also allows for the scope-marker}

\subsection{Declarative fo (continued from last time)}
\exg. ɲón-dɔ́ té bòndú á swèè sã̀\\
who-3SG.ɔSER say Bondu AUX.PST meat buy\\
`who said that Bondu bought meat?' \jf{(matrix wh question, embedded declarative }\\

\exg. ɲón-dɔ́ té bòndú á fèn sã̀\\
who-3SG.ɔSER say Bondu AUX.PST what buy\\
`who said that Bondu bought what?' \jf{(This is an assumed translation of a non-elicited sentence that Tony accidentally provided. If it's correct, it's an interesting example of matrix and embedded wh}\\

\jf{Above was answered with te instead of fo. Fo below}

\exg. ɲón-á fɔ̀-ì-jè bòndú á swèè sã̀\\
who-AUX.PST say-2SG-to Bondu AUX.PST meat buy\\
`who said that Bondu bought meat?' \jf{(matrix wh question, embedded declarative }\\

\exg. ɲón-á fɔ̀-ì-jè bòndú á fèn sã̀\\
who-AUX.PST say-2SG-to Bondu AUX.PST what buy\\
`who said that Bondu bought what?' \jf{(another unelicited example with matrix and embedded wh)}\\

\exg. ɲón-á fɔ̀-ì-jè bòndú á fènè-mín sã̀\\
who-AUX.PST say-2SG-to Bondu AUX.PST thing-which buy\\
`who said that Bondu bought which thing?' \jf{(another unelicited example with matrix and embedded wh)}\\

\exg. j-á fɔ̀ tìmà-mìn-ànà-mù bòndú á swèè sã̀ \\

`when did you say (it was) that Bondu bought meat?' \jf{(long-distance adjunct question )}\\

\exg. j-ɔ́ té tìmà-mìn-ànà-mù bòndú á swèè sã̀ \\
2SG-3SG.ɔSER say time-which-ANA-COP Bondu AUX.PST meat buy\\
`when did you say (it was) that Bondu bought meat?' \jf{(long-distance adjunct question. This one has te. I wonder if the other can have te, if IO seems to be a determining factor)}\\

\exg. j-á fɔ̀ sɔ̀jɔ̀ bòndú á swèè sã̀ \\
2SG-PST say when Bondu AUX.PST meat buy\\
`when did you say that Bondu bought meat?' \jf{(long-distance adjunct question }\\

\exg. j-á fɔ̀-n-d͡ʒè tìmà-mìn-ànà bòndú á swèè sã̀ \\
2SG-PST say-1SG-to time-which-ANA Bondu AUX.PST meat buy\\
`when did you say that Bondu bought meat?' \jf{(matrix adjunct question, embedded declarative }\\

\exg. j-á fɔ̀-n-d͡ʒè sɔ̀jɔ̀ bòndú á swèè sã̀ \\
2SG-PST say-1SG-to when Bondu AUX.PST meat buy\\
`when did you say that Bondu bought meat?' \jf{(matrix adjunct question, embedded declarative }\\

\jf{The main difference between the long distance and the matrix adjunct seems to be in the presence of the indirect object and the ability to add a copula to which time.}


\exg. ì-n-á fɔ̀-n-d͡ʒè bòndú á swéé sã́ \\
2SG-(?)-AUX.PST say-1SG-to Bondu AUX.PST meat buy\\
`Did you say (lit: tell me) that Bondu bought meat?' \jf{(matrix y/n question, embedded declarative ) (NOTE: again we have this "n" with Y/N question)}\\

\exg. ɱ̀fán-á fɔ̀ / bòndú á fènè-mín sã̀ \\
1SG.STRONG-AUX.PST  say / Bondu AUX.PST thing-which buy\\
`I said what Bondu bought' \jf{(matrix DECL, embedded WH }\\

\exg. ɱ̀fán-á fɔ̀ / tìmà-mìn-ànà-mù bòndú á swèè sã̀ \\
1SG.STRONG-AUX.PST say / time-which-ANA-COP Bondu AUX.PST meat buy\\
`I said when (it was that) Bondu bought meat' \jf{(matrix DECL, embedded adjunct Q }\\

\jf{Slashes above to indicate meaningfully long pauses}\\

\exg. n-á fɔ̀-ì-jè bòndú á fènè-mín sã̀ \\
1SG-AUX.PST say-2SG-to Bondu AUX.PST thing-which buy\\
`I said which thing Bondu bought' \jf{(matrix DECL, embedded Y/N - harder context - maybe someone keeps asking a question, and you're tired of supplying the answer over and over again}\\

\jf{NOTE: For the above, it didn't seem like we were able to get an embedded Y/N with this structure. Had to be replaced by a wh-phrase}\\

\subsection{Negation:}



\subsubsection{te:}

\jf{NOTE: We had a hard time eliciting negatives with te, which might be something we need to try to do again to see if the fo info is worith using.}\\

`I didn't say whether Bondu bought meat yesterday' \jf{(Embedded Y/N -> NOTE: This isn't really embedded Y/N seems more like "I didn't say that Bondu BOUGHT MEAT yesterday)}\\

who-NEG-AUX.PST say-NEG-1SG-to Bondu AUX.PST meat buy yesterday\\
`who didn't say that Bondu bought meat yesterday?' \jf{(Matrix wh) - context: everyone agreed that Bondu bought meat, except one person}\\


\jf{Proper long distance with negation was ostensibly not possible.}

\exg. bòndú-ní ím-á fèn sã̀ -nì kùnù\\

`What did you not say that Bondu bought yesterday?' \jf{(This failed. "too many fens," per Tony. Suggests that long distance wh with matrix scope marker and negative doesn't work.)}\\
