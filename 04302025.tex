\subsection{More on anaphoric ã}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Can ã be used in president sentences?

   this.year chief short next.year chief DEM tall DA WAN\\
   This year, the chief is short. Next year, the same chief will be tall.

    Does the following convey the same meaning?
    \exg. sandʒa mansa wuu. jaj ã mansa jansã da wã.\\
   this.year chief short next.year ANA chief tall DA WAN\\
   This year, the chief is short. Next year, the same chief will be tall.

   \item Can ã be used in part-whole bridging?

        1SG-AUX.PST house buy 3.SG door open\\
        I bought a house. \textbf{The door} was open. (Lit. `...its door is open.)

        1SG.AUX.PST house buy ANA door open\\
         I bought a house. \textbf{The door} was open. (Lit. `...its door is open.)

        3-SG.AUX.PST lock new buy 3.SG key big\\
        `I bought a new lock. The key is big.' (Lit. `...Its key is big.')

    Does the following convey the same meaning?

        1SG-AUX.PST lock new buy ANA key big\\
        `I bought a new lock. The key is big.' (Lit. `...Its key is big.')

`He/she\textsubscript{i/k} has Bondu\textsubscript{i}'s key.' (Context: Bondu asks us to take something in her house, and we arrive at her house. However, I forgot to take Bondu's key with me, and my friend pointing to other guy says that: Don't worry; he/she has Bondu's key.) \chs{I'm not sure how this sentence compared with the above can make the reference different, espeically in both sentences `Bondu' doesn't seem to be bound.}

`Bondu\textsubscript{i}'s older brother has it\textsubscript{*i/k}.' \chs{The pronoun is interpreted most likely as an inanimate object and also as a baby according to Tony, but even if Bondu is a baby, the pronoun cannot refer to Bondu, and hence the Condition C violation may be present.}

Bondu A-key WA 3SG.SER1-hand \\
`Bondu\textsubscript{i} has her\textsubscript{k} keys.' \chs{This sentence is identical to (7) but with a unexpected interpretation, and I can only think of topicalization (with the segmentation here) that may derive this meaning, but also needs double-checked.}
