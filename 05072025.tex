\subsection{fo + ami, proper long distance, no scope marking}

\exg. kàì á fɔ̀-ì-jé bòndú á fèn sàŋ kùnù.\\
Kai AUX.PST say-2SG-to Bondu AUX.PST what buy yesterday\\
`Kai told you what Bondu bought yesterday' \jf{(NOT A QUESTION - Per Tony, could be a response to a question)} \\

\exg. kàì á fɔ̀-ì-jé bòndú á fènè sàŋ kùnù.\\
Kai AUX.PST say-2SG-to Bondu AUX.PST something buy yesterday\\
`Kai told you that Bondu bought something yesterday' \jf{(Unlike with "ami" you can have both fen and fene embedded here.)} \\

\exg.  Kàì á fèn àmí bòndú á fèn sàŋ kùnù\\
Kai AUX.PST what hear Bondu AUX.PST what buy yesterday\\
`What did Kai hear that Bondu bought yesterday?' \jf{(Tony corrected me - no "m" at end of "ami" - YES QUESTION)}\\

\jf{If above is okay, and is a question, check answer:}

Kai AUX.PST hear Bondu AUX.PST what buy yesterday\\
`?Kai heard regarding what Bondu bought yesterday.' \jf{This was corrected to the above example, but seemed to maybe work on a marginal or infelicitous level.}\\


\subsection{Long-distance questions with think and ask:}

\subsubsection{Reconfirm that the following are questions:}

\exg. kàì á j-ɔ̀ tìsá bòndú á fèn sàŋ kùnù\\
Kai AUX.PST 2SG-ɔSER ask Bondu AUX.PST what buy yesterday\\
`Kai asked you what Bondu bought yesterday.' \jf{(Statement, not Q)}\\  


\exg. kàì á j-ɔ̀ tìsá káàmá bòndú á fèn sàŋ kùnù\\

\section{Mingyang}
\subsection{More on anaphoric ã}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Can ã be used with negation?
    \ex. `There is a teacher in the place of learning. Bondu doesn't know the teacher.'
\jf{Needs transcription}
    \item Can ã be used with a plural NP?
    \ex. `There are several teachers in the place of learning. The teachers are sitting in the back.'
\jf{Needs transcription}
    \item Can ã be used with a relative clause?\\
    Two situations - 1) Bondu has prior knowledge of the cassava leaves in the pot and 2) Bondu has no idea that there are cassava leaves in the pot.
    \ex. (Adapted from Arkoh 2011)\\
    `Bondu, bring the cassava leaves that are in the pot.'
\jf{Needs transcription}
    \item Can ã be used with epithet definites?
    \ex. (Adapted from Ahn \& Schwarz 2023)\\
    `Bondu came to my house. That idiot broke my pot.'
\jf{Needs transcription}    
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Situation-based co-variation}
   \ex. (Adapted from Jenks \& Konate 2022)\\
    \textit{Context: It is well known that chiefs are mean and grumpy people.}\\
    `In all the villages, the people don’t like the chief.'
\jf{Needs transcription}
    cf.:
    \ex. (Adapted from Jenks \& Konate 2022)\\
    \textit{Context: There is a chief, namely Bondu, who is mean to everybody; nobody from any village likes her.}\\
    `In all the villages, the people don’t like the chief.'
\jf{Needs transcription & addition of tested phrases}

\chs{\textbf{A. Variable binding}}

\exg. K\`{a}nd\'{i}\`{e} \`{m}-m\'{a} B\`{o}nd\'{u} jẽ́ẽ́-n\'{i}. \\
student M-NEG Bondu see-NEG \\
`Students did not see Bondu.'

\exg. K\`{a}nd\'{i}\`{e} k\`{a}ṍkã̀  m\'{a} B\`{o}nd\'{u} jẽ́ẽ́-n\'{i}. \\
student all.category NEG Bondu see-NEG \\
`All categories of students did not see Bondu.' \chs{The word k\`{a}ṍkã̀  means `all categories', such as from the high school, college ... in this case}

\exg. B\`{o}nd\'{u} \`{a} k\`{a}nd\'{i}\`{e}-gb\'{e} jẽ́ẽ́. \\
Bondu AUX.PST student-all see \\
`Bondu saw all students.'

\exg. B\`{o}nd\'{u} \`{a} k\`{a}nd\'{i}\`{e} k\`{a}ṍkã̀  jẽ̀ẽ̀-fã̀. \\
Bondu AUX.PST student all.category see-FAN \\
`Bondu saw all categories of students.'


\chs{It appears that no clear variable binding is found, as the negation comes from the clausal negator and the pronoun is plural, which may be confused with coreference.} \newline

\exg. K\`{a}nd\'{i}\`{e} (k\`{a}ṍkã̀)  m\'{a} d\`{e}-jẽ́ẽ́-n\'{i}. \\
student (all.category) NEG mother-see-NEG \\
`No student\textit{\scriptsize{i}} saw (his\textit{\scriptsize{i}}) mother.' \chs{I am not so sure about this sentence, because Tony seemed to take  k\`{a}ṍkã̀  away when he was explaining the difference with the plural one.}

\exg. K\`{a}nd\'{i}\`{e} k\`{a}ṍkã̀ m(a) -ã̀n-d\`{e} dʒẽ́ẽ́-n\'{i}. \\
student all.category NEG -3PL.SER1-mother see-NEG \\
`All categories of students\textit{\scriptsize{i}} did not see their\textit{\scriptsize{i}} mother.' \chs{Maybe this is not a good example for variable binding as the negation is the clausal negator instead of the negative quantifier, and thus it has some chance of being interpreted as co-reference?} 

\exg. \`{A}-d\`{e} m\'{a} k\`{a}nd\'{i}\`{e} k\`{a}ṍkã̀  dʒẽ́ẽ́-n\'{i}. \\
3SG.SER1-mother NEG student all.category see-NEG \\
`His\textit{\scriptsize{k}} mother saw no student\textit{\scriptsize{i}}.'

\exg. Ã̀-d\^{e} m\'{a} k\`{a}nd\'{i}\`{e} k\`{a}ṍkã̀  dʒẽ́ẽ́-n\'{i}. \\
3PL.SER1-mother NEG student all.category see-NEG \\
`Their\textit{\scriptsize{i}} mothers saw no student\textit{\scriptsize{i}}.'

3SG.self 3SG.PST Bondu see mirror-in \\
`He\textsubscript{*i/k} saw Bondu\textsubscript{i} in the mirror.' \chs{The morpheme can survive the unbound position with a reference to a third person, which appears not like reflexives.}

Bondu-PL- 3PL.SER1-each.other-see (mirror-in)\\
`Bondu and somebody else saw each other (in the mirror).' \chs{the plural marking seems like associatives}

\alex{\ref{26890} is good evidence for an intervening morpheme between the subject pronoun and the non-past auxiliary. If there was nothing intervening, we would expect [3PL-NPST] = [an-(w)e] = [ambe]. Instead, we get [an-ɛɛ].}

\exg.

3PL   AUX   close-A,   then   bondu   came \\%
`They were closing, then Bondu came.' \label{17800}

\alex{\ref{17800} is interesting, since there does not seem to be any overt intervener between the subject pronoun and the `ni' auxiliary. Not sure what to say about this, especially in light of my observation/comment for \ref{26890}.}

\exg.

Int. `They melted.' \label{42408}

\alex{\ref{42408} helps demonstrate that the ɔ object marker is highly dependent on the lexical verb. Possibly more evidence for a ``quirky case'' kind of analysis?}

\exg.

3PL   OBJ   AUX   melt-A,   then   Bondu   came \\%
`They were melting, then Bondu came.' \label{31232}

\alex{\ref{31232} is exactly the kind of example I've been looking for, where the a- object marker clearly occurs before the auxiliary. This example presents an interesting contrast with \ref{17800}, where we don't see the intervening object marker. Not sure what to make of this variability yet. Nonetheless, \ref{31232} is good evidence for something.}
